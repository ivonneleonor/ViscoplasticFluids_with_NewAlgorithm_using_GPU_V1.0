An optimization of Viscoplastic Fluid model using GPU and a new algorithm

An optimization of Viscoplastic Fluid model using GPU and a new algorithm

This file has some recommendations to compile and run the code.

This repository has four main versions of the code. The original code was named Alg2FixSerial7_bueno, the original code in serial with the new algorithm is Alg2FixSerialNewAlgorithm3_bueno, the code in parallel is Alg2FixParallelbueno and the code in parallel with the new algorithm is ParallelwithNewAlgoritmBueno.

To run any of these versions we recommend to run in Linux command line:

make clean

make

./Alg2Fix

The code was tested for different cases and combinations of parameters of Viscoplastic fluids. The code will be continued to be tested and integrated.
